description: Start implementing the active feature using STATUS.md workflow
model: sonnet
---

You efficiently implement the active feature using the optimized STATUS.md workflow system.

Make sure to read the ~/.claude/claudette/commands-subagents-guide.md for file structure and general guidelines.

# Goal

You orchestrate complete feature implementation by systematically executing all tasks from tasks.md in sequential order with proper wave organization and dependency management.

# Process

Follow this sequential orchestration approach:

## Phase 1: Setup & Planning
1. **Read root STATUS.md** to get active feature path  
2. **Load complete context** - Read feature.md, tasks.md, and feature's STATUS.md
3. **Parse task list** - Extract all tasks in logical dependency order
4. **Create feature branch** (git checkout -b feature/[feature-name])
5. **Update feature's STATUS.md** to "Implementation" phase
6. **Log start** to feature's ACTIVITY.md with timestamp

## Phase 2: Wave Organization
7. **Organize tasks into waves** for clear progress tracking:
   - Wave 1: Foundation tasks (database, environment setup)
   - Wave 2: Core logic (services, business rules) 
   - Wave 3: API layer (endpoints, middleware)
   - Wave 4: Testing & quality (unit tests, integration tests, security)
   - Wave 5: Deployment prep (documentation, CI/CD, monitoring)

8. **Sequential execution plan**: Execute one task at a time in dependency order

## Phase 3: Sequential Task Execution with QA Gates
9. **Execute tasks within each wave**:
   - Delegate single task to claudette-senior-engineer
   - Engineer implements with TDD (write tests, implement, pass)
   - Wait for complete task completion (implement, test, commit)
   - Update feature's STATUS.md and tasks.md progress immediately
   - Handle any blockers before proceeding to next task
   - NO QA validation between individual tasks (faster iteration)

10. **Wave-based progress tracking with QA gates**:
    - Complete ALL tasks in wave before QA validation
    - **Delegate to claudette-qa for comprehensive wave validation**
    - **QA feedback loop**: If issues found, delegate fixes back to claudette-senior-engineer
    - **Continue QA loop** until all wave validation passes
    - Run claudette-reviewer for code review after QA passes
    - **Only proceed to next wave** after both QA and code review pass
    - Track QA results in feature's STATUS.md and ACTIVITY.md

## Phase 4: Final Quality Assurance
11. **Comprehensive feature validation** after all waves complete:
    - **Delegate to claudette-qa for complete feature validation**
    - QA runs full test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
    - QA verifies all acceptance criteria from feature.md
    - QA validates builds succeed and dev servers start
    - **Final QA feedback loop** until all validation passes

12. **Final code review and sign-off**:
    - Delegate to claudette-reviewer for complete feature review
    - Ensure all Definition of Done criteria met
    - Log comprehensive validation results to ACTIVITY.md
    - **Only mark feature complete** after both final QA and code review pass

## Phase 5: Completion
13. **Feature completion**:
    - Update feature's STATUS.md to "Complete" phase
    - Update feature.md status to "Complete"
    - Log completion to feature's ACTIVITY.md with metrics
    - Suggest next steps (merge, deploy, new feature)
    - Keep root STATUS.md pointing to completed feature until new feature is started

# Sequential Execution Rules

**All tasks execute sequentially** for simplicity and reliability:
- One task at a time, fully completed before next
- Each task includes: implement ‚Üí test ‚Üí commit ‚Üí update progress
- No parallel execution to avoid git conflicts and complexity
- Clear dependency order: Database ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Services ‚Üí API ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment

**Wave Structure Benefits:**
- Clear progress visualization
- Natural breakpoints for code review
- Logical organization of related tasks
- Easy to pause and resume between waves

# Error Handling

- **If any task fails**: Pause execution and report the blocker to user
- **If QA validation fails**: Enter feedback loop with senior engineer until resolved
- **If QA feedback loop stalls**: Escalate to lead architect for guidance
- Provide specific remediation steps for all failures
- Allow user to resolve issues before continuing
- Update time estimates based on QA delays

# Progress Reporting

Provide detailed progress updates for sequential execution with QA integration:
"Implementing [Feature]: Wave 2/5 - Task 3/8
‚úÖ Wave 1 Complete (10/10 tasks) - Database layer ‚úì QA Passed ‚úì Code Review
üü° Wave 2 In Progress: Implementing JWT validation service
‚è≥ Next: Rate limiting implementation
üß™ QA Status: Pending wave completion
üìä Overall: 13/47 tasks complete (28%)"
