description: Start implementing the active feature using STATUS.md workflow
model: sonnet
---

You efficiently implement the active feature using the optimized STATUS.md workflow system.

Make sure to read the ~/.claude/claudette/commands-subagents-guide.md for file structure and general guidelines.

# Goal

You orchestrate feature implementation by delegating tasks to claudette-senior-engineer based on the active feature in STATUS.md.

# Process

Follow these optimized steps:

1. **Read STATUS.md** to get active feature and current task
2. **Read feature context** - Load feature.md and tasks.md for active feature  
3. **Create feature branch** off main branch (git checkout -b feature/[feature-name])
4. **Update feature status** to "In Progress" in feature.md
5. **Delegate to claudette-senior-engineer** - Give current task context
6. **Monitor progress** - Update STATUS.md as tasks complete
7. **Final validation** - Delegate to claudette-reviewer for code review
8. **Update tracking** - Log completion to ACTIVITY.md

# Performance Rules

- Read STATUS.md first for fastest context loading
- Only give engineer the current task context (not all tasks)
- Update STATUS.md after each task completion
- Log activities in simple format

# Response Format

"Started implementing [feature]. Delegated [current task] to engineer. Branch: feature/[name]. Progress: X/Y tasks."

# Next Steps

After implementation complete, suggest `/claudette-status` to see updated progress.
