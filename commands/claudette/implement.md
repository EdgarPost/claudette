description: Start implementing the active feature using STATUS.md workflow
model: sonnet
---

You efficiently implement the active feature using the optimized STATUS.md workflow system.

Make sure to read the ~/.claude/claudette/commands-subagents-guide.md for file structure and general guidelines.

# Goal

You orchestrate complete feature implementation by systematically executing all tasks from tasks.md with parallel execution where possible and proper dependency management.

# Process

Follow this comprehensive orchestration approach:

## Phase 1: Setup & Planning
1. **Read STATUS.md** to get active feature  
2. **Load complete context** - Read feature.md and tasks.md for full understanding
3. **Analyze task dependencies** - Identify which tasks can run in parallel vs sequential
4. **Create feature branch** (git checkout -b feature/[feature-name])
5. **Update feature status** to "In Progress" in feature.md
6. **Log start** to ACTIVITY.md with timestamp

## Phase 2: Task Orchestration Strategy
7. **Parse all tasks** from tasks.md and group by:
   - **Parallel tasks**: Can run simultaneously (independent setup, documentation)
   - **Sequential tasks**: Must wait for dependencies (database ‚Üí services ‚Üí API ‚Üí tests)
   - **Batch tasks**: Similar tasks that can be grouped (multiple unit tests, multiple endpoints)

8. **Create execution waves**:
   - Wave 1: Foundation tasks (database, environment setup)
   - Wave 2: Core logic (services, business rules) 
   - Wave 3: API layer (endpoints, middleware)
   - Wave 4: Testing & quality (unit tests, integration tests, security)
   - Wave 5: Deployment prep (documentation, CI/CD, monitoring)

## Phase 3: Systematic Execution
9. **Execute each wave systematically**:
   - For each wave, delegate parallel tasks simultaneously to multiple claudette-senior-engineer instances
   - Wait for wave completion before starting next wave
   - Update STATUS.md and tasks.md progress after each task completion
   - Handle errors and blockers immediately

10. **Continuous monitoring**:
    - Track progress: X/Y tasks complete per phase
    - Log decisions and issues to ACTIVITY.md
    - Update time estimates based on actual completion

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance
11. **Automated quality checks** after each major phase:
    - Delegate to claudette-reviewer for code review
    - Run automated tests and report results
    - Validate acceptance criteria from feature.md

12. **Final validation** after all tasks complete:
    - Complete code review of entire feature
    - Validate all Definition of Done criteria
    - Run full test suite and security scans

## Phase 5: Completion
13. **Feature completion**:
    - Update feature.md status to "Complete"
    - Update STATUS.md with completion status
    - Log completion to ACTIVITY.md with metrics
    - Suggest next steps (merge, deploy, new feature)

# Parallel Execution Rules

**Tasks that CAN run in parallel:**
- Independent setup tasks (environment config, documentation updates)
- Multiple unit test files for different components
- Multiple API endpoint implementations (if no shared dependencies)
- Documentation tasks while development is happening

**Tasks that MUST be sequential:**
- Database schema ‚Üí Repository layer ‚Üí Service layer ‚Üí API layer
- Core services ‚Üí Integration tests (need services to exist)
- API endpoints ‚Üí API integration tests
- Implementation ‚Üí Code review ‚Üí Deployment

# Error Handling

- If any task fails, pause execution and report the blocker
- Provide specific remediation steps
- Allow user to resolve issue before continuing
- Update time estimates based on delays

# Progress Reporting

Provide detailed progress updates:
"Implementing [Feature]: Wave 2/5 in progress
‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete (10/10 tasks) - Database layer ready
üü° Phase 2 In Progress (3/8 tasks) - Auth service 60% complete
‚è≥ Phases 3-5 Queued
Next: Complete JWT token validation, then start API layer"

# Response Format

**Initial Start:**
"Starting systematic implementation of [Feature]. Analyzed [X] tasks across [Y] phases. Created feature branch. Wave 1: Foundation layer starting with [N] parallel tasks."

**Wave Progress:**
"Wave [X] complete: [completed tasks]. Wave [X+1] starting: [next tasks]. Overall progress: [X/Y] tasks ([Z%])"

**Completion:**
"Feature [Name] implementation complete! All [X] tasks finished. Code review passed. Ready for deployment. Time: [actual] vs [estimated]."
